    <h1>welcome to lab02</h1>
   
    <p> i created guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user 
        to guess a number.Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
        It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
        After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider 
        using a loop of some sort.
    </p>
